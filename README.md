# trainingTracker

Track member tool/equipment inductions through Slack using TidyHQ as a backend.

## For users

* Provides information regarding the tool sign off process
* Check existing sign offs and information about machines not yet signed off
* Provides encouragement to learn new tools
* Increases awareness of available tools

## For trainers

* Check the sign offs for a particular user
* Find all users signed off on a particular tool
* Maintain contact list of authorised users for relevant notifications
* Refresh the list of tools and potential trainees from TidyHQ without leaving the app
* Add or remove authorisations for trainees in way that promotes group consensus amongst trainers

## For administrators

* Sign offs are stored as TidyHQ groups, no significant learning barrier to migrating in the future
* Trainer permissions are managed through Slack groups
* Includes configurable caching and processing offloading to allow for different usage levels and API limits

## Setup

* Ensure that TidyHQ credentials have been set in `config.json`
* `cp machines.json.example machines.json`
  * Configure at least one report. Report names should be alphanumeric.
  * Groups in TidyHQ that have a description set will be parsed for information. Each provided parameter should be on a new line and presented as `key=value`. Supported info is:
    * `url` = When this group appears as the header to a **report** column it will be linked to this page. No checking is done on the content of the field so it supports internal/external/relative/absolute links.
    * `level` = Included after the name of a group/tool if present. Field can include unicode characters eg ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢. Within the Slack bot this will default to âšª if not specified.
    * `training` = Information regarding training. Displayed to a user checking their own sign offs via the Slack bot **if** they are not signed off on that tool.

## Markdown category output

Formats a markdown table of approved operators based on whether a contact is in a configured TidyHQ group.

Passing the special report name "all" will generate a report including a deduplicated list of all other reports. Specific groups can be excluded from this report by adding them to the special "exclude" group.

`markdown_report.py` will output a list of possible reports including their contents with human readable names rather than just IDs. The script will exit with an error code to catch it being executed without a report name accidentally in automations.

`markdown_report.py report_name` will output a markdown formatted table. It explicitly does not include a "generated on" line so that it doesn't trigger unnecessary page changes.

This can be used to push a report by:

* Cloning the wiki
* `sed -i '11,$ d' path/to/wiki_page` - Remove the contents of the page after the header (header is typically 10 lines)
* `python3 operator_report.py report_name >> path/to/wiki_page`
* Commit the changed file

## Statistics

`report.py` can be used to generate a number of useful statistics about overall training coverage

## Slack Bot

This bot includes various functions for users and trainers.

`./slack.py [-cv]`

* **-v** - Debug/verbose mode
* **-c** - Update all user homes, designed to be run as a cronjob to decrease loading times for new users
